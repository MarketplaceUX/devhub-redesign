# Firefox Marketplace Developer Site Redesign

To view the actual design documentation please visit the site at: http://tsmuse.github.io/FirefoxMarketplaceDevPagesDesign/

This branch is home to all the individual files used in the process of the redesign (flow diagrams, prototypes, etc).<br>
The redesign documentation itself lives in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/tsmuse/FirefoxMarketplaceDevPagesDesign/tree/gh-pages)

## Working Files Folders in the branch

#### [App Creation - Country / Price / Payments][2]

#### [App Creation/Editing, and Managing Versions][3]

This file will be split so functionalities don’t overlap and they’re easier to critique.
